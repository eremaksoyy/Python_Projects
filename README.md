This repository has projects done using Python language (algorithms, scientific computing, games, etc.). 

Data Science related Python projects are in the folder "DataScienceRelated". They include practices of PyTorch, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas (Scientific Computing), Keras, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow (Machine Learning algorithms implementations). It also has a concise code for image (frame) extraction from a video for data labeling (done the labeling part with labelImg-YOLO).

Games&Others folder has projects using libraries/packages such as Turtle, Pandas, and Tkinter.

Go to the Master branch for all the code files!
